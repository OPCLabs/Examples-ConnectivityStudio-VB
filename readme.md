This directory contains examples for OPC client and subscriber development in Visual Basic (the "classic" VB 6.0). The 
examples cover OPC Data Access (OPC DA), OPC Alarms&Events (OPC A&E), OPC XML, and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) 
specifications, including OPC UA PubSub. They are supported on Microsoft Windows.

The examples work with our sample servers and publishers. Most of them reside on the Web; OPC "Classic" servers for Windows
are installed using the [Connectivity Software Setup program](https://www.opclabs.com/download).
